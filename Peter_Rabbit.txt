Once upon a time there were four little rabbits and their names were- Flopsy,
Mopsy, CottonTail and Peter. They lived with their Mother in a sand bank,
beneath the root of a very big fir tree. 'Now, my dears,' said their old Mrs. Rabbit
one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but please don't
go into Mr. McGregor's garden. Your Father had an accident there; he was put
into a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now run along and don't get into mischief. I am
going out.' Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through
the woods to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant
buns. Flopsy, Mopsy and CottonTail, who were good little bunnies, went down
the lane to gather blackberries. But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight
away into Mr McGregorâ€™s garden, where there were lots of tasty things to eat. 
He squeezed under the gate and set off to explore. First he ate some lettuces
and some beans; then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he
went to look for some parsley. But, at the end of the cucumber frame, who
should he meet but Mr McGregor! Mr McGregor was on his hands and knees
planting cabbages. When he saw Peter he jumped up and ran after him with a rake.
