It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn,
the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked
beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in
the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The
corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the
midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk
about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farmhouse
close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew
great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little
child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick
wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young 
brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little
ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any
visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river
than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her.
