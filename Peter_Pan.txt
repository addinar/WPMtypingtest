All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up,
and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was
playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her
mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling
put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this
for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth
Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the 
beginning of the end. Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother
was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet
mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other,
that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more;
and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there 
it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner. The way Mr. Darling won her was
this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously
that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling,
who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.
